To find out what features the module has, type **``/banana``**  in the chat. Some commands require you to have characters selected. It's very simple!

## Contact 

Please leave your suggestions, questions, doubts in the Issues or look me up on Discord, I'll be happy to talk to you.

## Known issues

This module changes the GGA ``.gurpslink`` CSS and you may not like it. To resolve this we have a few options:

- /journal is not working well with journal with multipages and pdfs. Someday   i'll fix it.
- Uninstall this module.
- Edit the module.css (I can help you with that)
- Suggest a cool change!

If you want this module in your language and would like to have it translated and want to translate (hehehe), please send me a message.
